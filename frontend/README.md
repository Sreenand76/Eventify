### Project Description
It is project based on upcoming event happening in our college ,where students can mark their attendance for their interested events

### The Problem Statement
With numerous events being organized in the college, it becomes difficult for event organizers to track the participation of students and for students to keep a record of the events they are attending. The challenge is to provide an efficient and easy-to-use platform where students can mark their attendance for the events they are interested in. The system should allow students to sign up for events, mark attendance, and provide event organizers with a consolidated view of attendees, improving event management and ensuring accurate attendance tracking

### The Solution
tracking how many people are attending event ,for easier management of event while keeping the students updated about the upcoming events in our college.
